Linkleap(MERN)

A simple URL shortener built with MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.
Paste a long URL, get a short link, and share it.
Visiting the short link instantly redirects to the original URL.

Redirect to original URLs
Admin view to track all links and visit counts


How It Works

1. User submits a long URL.
2. Backend stores it with a short code.
3. Visiting `/{shortcode}` redirects to the original link.
